- 👋 Hi, I’m Jenny! @jenfullerton (she/her/hers).
- 👀 I’m interested in technical art (particularly visual effects and shaders in video games), UI, UX, and finding interesting ways to combine art and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently app design using .NET / WPF and improving my C#.
- 🌲 I have experience in using the Unity engine, HLSL / Three.js shader programming, and teaching high school Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small games and small programming projects with a focus on graphics.
- 📫 Contact: jennifer.k.fullerton@gmail.com
