- 👋 Hi, I’m Jenny! @jenfullerton (she/her/hers).
- 👀 I’m interested in technical art (particularly visual effects and shaders in video games), UI, UX, and finding interesting ways to combine art and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently experimenting with app design using .NET / WPF and improving my C#.
- 🌲 I have experience in using the Unity engine, shader programming (HSLS, WebGL), and teaching high school computer science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small games and small programming projects with a focus on graphics, VFX, and any other ways we can combine art and code.
- 📫 Contact: jennifer.k.fullerton@gmail.com
